Pervasive and mobile computing technologies can make our everyday living environments and our cities "smart", i.e., capable of reaching awareness of physical and social processes and of dynamically affecting them in a purposeful way [1]. This is already happening, e.g., in the form of digital traffic signs that suggest in real-time the best traffic directions or the availability of parking spots, and also in the form of location-based social networks that inform us about noteworthy events. Soon we expect that the pervasive diffusion of sensing, actuation, and computing will allow our urban environment to fully self-regulate in autonomy most of its processes, and to guide and support our everyday activities.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
